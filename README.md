1. **Content-Based Recommendation:**
   - Select a test movie (e.g., "The Matrix") and run the content-based recommendation system.
   - Verify that the system outputs a list of recommended movies based on the similarity of content features.

2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation:**
   - Choose a test user ID (e.g., User ID = 1) and run the collaborative filtering system.
   - Check that the system suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.
